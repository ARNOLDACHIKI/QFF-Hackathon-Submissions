## Short Description

Q-Vote is a next-generation voting platform that combines quantum-resistant cryptography, blockchain immutability, and biometric verification to deliver a secure, transparent, and accessible election system ‚Äî especially tailored for Kenya's electoral context.

## Quick Links
 - Demo screenshots: `screenshot1.png` ‚Ä¶ `screenshot7.png`
 - Repository: https://github.com/ARNOLDACHIKI/q-vote.git

## Why this matters (Kenya, 2027)

 - Restores trust after disputed elections by providing cryptographic proof of integrity
 - Eliminates manual result transmission (no more Forms 34A/34B manipulation)
 - Enables diaspora voting for 3M+ Kenyans abroad
 - Reduces election costs and dependence on KIEMS hardware

## How it works ‚Äî at a glance

1. Voter registration with biometric verification and national ID linking
2. Authentication using quantum-secured keys + biometrics + OTP
3. Vote encryption using QKD-generated session keys
4. Encrypted vote submission to smart contract (Ethereum/Polygon testnet)
5. Voter receives a unique verification code (SMS + in-app) to confirm recording
6. Smart contracts handle tallying and publish live, auditable results

## Architecture (layers)

 - Quantum Security Layer: QKD (BB84) + post-quantum cryptography (Qiskit Terra/Aer)
 - Blockchain Layer: Smart contracts for eligibility, casting, anti-duplication, tallying
 - Identity & Registration: Biometric capture, document verification, IPRS integration
 - Voter Interface: React PWA + React Native, low-bandwidth & USSD fallback

## Technical stack

 - Frontend: React.js (PWA)
 - Backend: Node.js / Flask APIs
 - Quantum: Qiskit (Terra, Aer)
 - Blockchain: Solidity smart contracts (Ethereum/Polygon testnet)
 - Storage: IPFS for encrypted biometric artefacts
 - Messaging: Africa's Talking / SMS gateways
 - Mobile: React Native (iOS/Android)

## Key Features

 - Quantum-resistant encryption (QKD + PQC)
 - Immutable on-chain vote records
 - Biometric multi-factor authentication
 - Remote and diaspora voting support
 - Voter verification codes and public audit trail
 - Low-bandwidth & USSD support for feature phones

## Notes for judges / reviewers

 - This project demonstrates integration of Qiskit-based QKD simulations with Web3 primitives to produce an end-to-end blockchain voting prototype. The focus is on security, transparency, and practical Kenyan election requirements.

If you'd like, I can also add a short CONTRIBUTING.md, a minimal `requirements.txt` for the quantum folder, or create placeholder screenshot files (blank PNGs) so the README renders immediately. Tell me which you'd prefer and I'll add them.
