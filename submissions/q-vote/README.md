## Short Description

Q-Vote is a next-generation voting platform that combines quantum-resistant cryptography, blockchain immutability, and biometric verification to deliver a secure, transparent, and accessible election system ‚Äî especially tailored for Kenya's electoral context.

## Quick Links
- Demo s: 
- Docs: `/docs` (if available)
- Repository: https://github.com/ARNOLDACHIKI/q-vote.git

## Why this matters (Kenya, 2027)

- Restores trust after disputed elections by providing cryptographic proof of integrity
- Eliminates manual result transmission (no more Forms 34A/34B manipulation)
- Enables diaspora voting for 3M+ Kenyans abroad
- Reduces election costs and dependence on KIEMS hardware

## How it works ‚Äî at a glance

1. Voter registration with biometric verification and national ID linking
2. Authentication using quantum-secured keys + biometrics + OTP
3. Vote encryption using QKD-generated session keys
4. Encrypted vote submission to smart contract (Ethereum/Polygon testnet)
5. Voter receives a unique verification code (SMS + in-app) to confirm recording
6. Smart contracts handle tallying and publish live, auditable results

## Architecture (layers)

- Quantum Security Layer: QKD (BB84) + post-quantum cryptography (Qiskit Terra/Aer)
- Blockchain Layer: Smart contracts for eligibility, casting, anti-duplication, tallying
- Identity & Registration: Biometric capture, document verification, IPRS integration
- Voter Interface: React PWA + React Native, low-bandwidth & USSD fallback

## Technical stack

- Frontend: React.js (PWA)
- Backend: Node.js / Flask APIs
- Quantum: Qiskit (Terra, Aer)
- Blockchain: Solidity smart contracts (Ethereum/Polygon testnet)
- Storage: IPFS for encrypted biometric artefacts
- Messaging: Africa's Talking / SMS gateways
- Mobile: React Native (iOS/Android)

## Key Features

- Quantum-resistant encryption (QKD + PQC)
- Immutable on-chain vote records
- Biometric multi-factor authentication
- Remote and diaspora voting support
- Voter verification codes and public audit trail
- Low-bandwidth & USSD support for feature phones

## How to run (developer notes)

These are example steps ‚Äî adapt to your implementation.

1. Clone the repo

  git clone <your-repo-url>

2. Frontend

  cd frontend
  npm install
  npm run dev

3. Backend

  cd backend
  pip install -r requirements.txt    # or npm install if Node
  flask run                          # or node server.js

4. Smart contracts

  cd contracts
  npm install
  npx hardhat test

5. Quantum simulations

  cd quantum
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python qkd_simulation.py

Replace commands above with actual scripts in your repo.

## Roadmap & Pilot Plan

- Phase 1 (2025): Pilot in university/county by-elections
- Phase 2 (2026): Scale to selected counties
- Phase 3 (Early 2027): National rollout preparation
- Phase 4 (Aug 2027): Full deployment for general elections

## How to include your s

1. Save the images to this directory with the filenames used above (1.png ‚Ä¶ 7.png).
2. Commit and push:

  git add 1.png 2.png ... README.md
  git commit -m "Add README and demo s"
  git push origin main

## Notes for judges / reviewers

- This project demonstrates integration of Qiskit-based QKD simulations with Web3 primitives to produce an end-to-end blockchain voting prototype. The focus is on security, transparency, and practical Kenyan election requirements.

If you'd like, I can also add a short CONTRIBUTING.md, a minimal `requirements.txt` for the quantum folder, or create placeholder  files (blank PNGs) so the README renders immediately. Tell me which you'd prefer and I'll add them.
